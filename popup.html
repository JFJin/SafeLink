        <h2>How this extension works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This extension highlights potentially dangerous links on the page that you are on.</li>
            <li>This is a prototype project that has a lot of problems which will be fixed in the coming models.</li>
            <li>The goal for the next few updates are: upgrading AI model to be more accurate, different colored highlights for different types of dangerous links, and more customization/quality-of-life updates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This model is made by a 15 year old high school student, the project is still being worked on as I hone my own skills to relese another update.</p>
